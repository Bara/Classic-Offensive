This mod is in beta, everything is subject to change!
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    How To Install
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
- Unzip the file into your Sourcemods folder often located here:
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods"
it must be on the same disk as Steam, or it won't work!
   
- Restart Steam (Exit it completely)
 
- The mod should now appear in your library
if it doesn't, double-check if you've followed the instructions correctly.
if you have CS:GO on an other drive it might be the problem.

    Launch Options Workaround
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Launch options don't work in many sourcemods and this is also a problem in csco. 
There is a workaround though.

Launch CSCO like this:
"C:/path/to/steam/steam.exe" -applaunch 730 -game "C:/path/to/steam/steamapps/sourcemods/csco" -your -launch -options -here
You can run this (Win + R) and it should launch with your launch options, 
but it's better just to put this line in a shortcut or a .bat file.
 
Or for Linux users:
steam -applaunch 730 -game "/home/user/.steam/steamapps/sourcemods/csco" -your -launch -options -here
