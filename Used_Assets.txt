			== Player Models ==

All playermodels were modified by me using CS:GO assets, those
are modified official Valve models and textures.

			== Sounds ==

All sounds are from CS:GO, CS:S and CS1.6, modifications were
made by me.

			== Maps ==

Dust2 and Inferno are heavely modified versions of the CSPromod's
Italy is CS:GO's, I've modified it quite a bit.
Mirage is based on this one: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=123769103
Pool Day is here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=122521875
Fy Snow is based on this version: http://gamebanana.com/maps/181276

Those maps are pretty much all placeholders but Italy.
			
			
			== WEAPONS ==

Those are mostly placeholders until I found a good modeler 
and animator

I've reanimated some of CS:S' models, using CS:GO's default anims
but most of them are just rigged on the original anims

- Thanezy AK47 http://gamebanana.com/skins/54505 made by Thanez

The rest if ported from CS:S or uses the same model as CS:GO
